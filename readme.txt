-----------------------------------------
Completely Done Functionality:

1.Signup
2.Login
3.Create/detele team
4.Manage team member
5.Instant team chat with chat history available

At this point, we have finished implementing all the functions above. 
All the above functions works perfectly well.
-----------------------------------------
Partially Done Functionality:

1.Creating, deleting and viewing posts are working perfectly. 
The "like" function is done, but needs debugging.


2.Event is partially done (now you can only see the calender printed). 
The API is done, frontend still in progress.

3.Sharing file API in progress, frontend in progress.
---------------------------------------------
Feedback needed:

We are kind of running out of ideas about what other functions can be added 
to our project.Do you have any suggestions regarding what else can be implemented 
in this project?
