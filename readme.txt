-----------------------------------------
Completely Done Functionality:

1.Signup
2.Login
3.Create/detele team
4.Manage team member
5.Instant team chat with chat history available

At this point, we have finished implementing all the functions above. 
All the above functions works perfectly well.
-----------------------------------------
Partially Done Functionality:

1.Creating, deleting and viewing posts are working perfectly. 
The "like" function is done, but needs debugging.


2.Event is partially done (now you can only see the calender printed). 
The API is done, frontend still in progress.

3.File sharing's API is in progress, frontend in progress while only the buttons 
are done and selecting files are done(locally).

Test accounts provided:

user name: test1@example.com
password: 123456

user name: test2@example.com
password: 123456

The two accounts above are for testing purpose which you can use to 
test our functionalities.

------------------------------------------------
Feedback needed:

We are kind of running out of ideas about what other functions can be added 
to our project.Do you have any suggestions regarding what else can be implemented 
in this project?
